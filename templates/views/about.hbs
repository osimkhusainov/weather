    <p class="aboutme">I believe that a test project can show much more than solving algorithmic problems. Iâ€™ve created some test samples using JavaScript and Cypress for you to look what my daily routine looks like.

<a href="https://github.com/osimkhusainov/api-and-ui-cypress">https://github.com/osimkhusainov/api-and-ui-cypress</a> - Here I created UI and API tests and also integrated Allure report with Jenkins

<a href="https://github.com/osimkhusainov/shairco">https://github.com/osimkhusainov/shairco</a> - Another great assessment for one company. Here I even was able to fix some UI bugs which are written on React and a couple of backend bugs that are written on Node.js and Express. I used Cypress for UI tests and Jest for Backend. All of them are written on TypeScript.
